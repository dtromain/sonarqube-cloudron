## About

SonarQube is a free software package for continuous code quality measurement. It helps to detect, classify and resolve defects in source code, identify code duplication, measure documentation levels and track test coverage.

SonarQube enables continuous monitoring of code quality, thanks to its web interface, which shows defects in the entire code and those added by new versions. The software can be interfaced with an automation system such as Jenkins to include analysis as an extension of development.
